Web page that shows text param, that's pretty much. Why, you might ask, for a really niche reason.

I started using NFC tags all around my house for various reason to display information. But iPhone (not sure about Android, haven't tested) won't open text-only record from an NFC tag. It will, however, open web links.

So by setting the NFC record to a URL with `text=Hello`, when scanning the tag, it'll open a web page saying "Hello".

That is pretty much all it does.a
